# graph_neural_nets

This is an attempt to assign coodinates to nodes within a Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) using Graph Convolutional Network (GCN).
<br>
**Input:** Virtual Coordinates, Adjacency Matrix of a Graph
<br>
**Output:** Topological Coordinates of a Graph
<br>

1. **Requirements:** To install the software requirements, run `pip3 install -r wsn/requirements.txt`
2. **How to execute:** The python program can be run from the current folder as : `python3 wsn/hidden_2_relu_g_200.py` 
2. `*.index` and `*.meta` files are tensorflow checkpoint files. They can be used to perform inference or continue training from the current state
instead of starting fresh from scratch.
3. The architecture of the model can be fund at `wsn/model_arch.png`
4. `wsn/learning_curves/` folder contains the matplotlib plots of cost-histories. The cost-histories themselves can be found at `wsn/cost_histories/` 
5. `wsn/etp.py` : This file contains the calculation of ETP cost as defined by Dhanapala et al, IEEE/ACM TON, 2014.
6. `wsn/calculate_virtual_coordinates.py` : This file contains the code to generate a geographic coordinates initially, then generates virtual cooadinates through flooding of the network.

The below graph represents the performance of an untrained GNN versus the TPM algorithm proposed in the paper IEEE/ACM TON paper Dhanapala et al, 2014.
